# MeanVarianceOptimz

Mean-Variance Optimization Project

This project focuses on MeanVariance Optimization in the context of three sectors: DAX ESG, DAX Dividend, and DAX Export. The objective is to select stocks from these sectors, use last 5 years of historical data until December 2023, to construct optimal portfolio weights. We compute the minimum volatility and maximum Sharpe ratio portfolios, and evaluate their out-of-sample performance for the first quarter of 2024. Additionally, we produce the efficient frontier for the DAX 40 index.
